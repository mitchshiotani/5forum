# About this project

This was a (not so) quick project I used to learn about the LAMP stack, the stack at my company. 

I learned about 
- how CGIs work (when you don't have an engine that handles routes)
- how to configure Apache
- creating a MySQL instance, building databases and tables, and also how to connect to it via Perl
- using an HTML generator library (Template Toolkit)
- how to create a software architecture document (check Architecture.md)

It's by no means production ready, but was a good experience to learn about the backbone of what my company's product was built around.
